		text: "La Negra is a theater production company created by actor and producer Carlos Amador in 2017 with the purpose of creating theater shows for children and youth using a poetic, visual language and a contemporary stage proposal based on experimentation and reflection. Their first show, \"In the Clouds\", premiered at the Mostra Internacional Mim in Sueca in 2017 and has been featured in festivals such as FIET in Mallorca, Muestra de Títeres de la Vall de Albaida, and FETEN in Gijón. It also toured extensively across the national territory and was part of the programming at the Centro Dramático Nacional in 2019. \"Nautilus, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\", the company's second production, premiered in November 2019 and has received numerous awards, including the FETEN Award for its original proposal and environmental awareness, as well as the \"R\" rating as a recommended show by the National Theater Network. It also won the Audience Award for the best show at Titirimurcia and the best family show award at the Mostra de teatre d'Alcoi. This production has established the company as a reference in object theater for children and families on a national level. In 2021, they premiered \"The Tree of Teneré\", a production that was released nationally at FETEN 2022, and in May 2024 it will be represented at the Golden Sparkle International Festival in Serbia."

They will last 30 minutes and will be subject to the company's availability. In this way, attendance at the show can be complemented with a chat with the team members, to whom they can present their conclusions or doubts about the work they have previously seen. A practical way to bring boys and girls closer to the theatrical profession, and to delve deeper into the themes that La Negra raises in its shows."

			title: "The Tree of Teneré",
			synopsis: "The Ténéré tree is a tree in the middle of the Sahara Desert, which for a long time was considered the loneliest and most isolated tree on Earth. But the Ténéré tree was not always alone. Millions of years ago in that same spot, right where it stands now, there were other trees like it, and wild plants and animals, and water. Especially water. Our Ténéré tree loves to reminisce about that time, and it also enjoys dancing and swaying with the wind. It even receives visits from Tuareg caravans in the middle of the night, or from sun-dazed wanderers seeking some shade under its branches. The story of our Ténéré tree is a tale of roots, light, and shadows."

		nautilus: {
			title: "Nautilus",
			synopsis: "Captain Nemo values the sea more than his own life. Nemo lives aboard the Nautilus, a secret submarine that travels the world's oceans, far from everyone and everything. But for some time now, the captain has noticed that coral reefs have turned into mountains of garbage, fish into plastic bags, and seagrass meadows into underwater dumpsites. Marine life is in danger, and Nemo is determined to prevent it, but he cannot do it alone. That's why he recruits Professor Aronax, whom he will take on a journey of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea to show him the secrets of this fascinating world threatened by human pollution. 'Nautilus' is a contemporary, committed, and ecological reading of the classic adventure novel '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea."

		clouds: {
			title: "In The Clouds",
			synopsis: "In the Clouds is the story of my friend. My friend sometimes feels different. My friend would sometimes fly away like a balloon and sneak into the universe. My friend has a friend who is a cloud. My friend is very lonely, and at the same time, friends emerge without realizing it. In the Clouds is a story that goes up and down. A work where soap bubbles turn into puppets, and where imagination takes over everything when reality turns its back. Pay attention to your dreams."

		grass: {
			title: "Mow the grass",
			synopsis: "Perhaps you've never taken the time to calmly observe what happens in the park. Who strolls, who sits on the benches, who exercises, or who plays by the fountain... We've forgotten to look closely, and it's in the details where the magic resides. It's the time when you connect with nature and accompany us to discover it. This park is the meeting place for people and animals. When we fall silent, the birds sing."
