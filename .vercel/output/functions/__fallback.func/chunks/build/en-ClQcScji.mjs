"Nautilus, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea", the company's second production, premiered in November 2019 and has received numerous awards, including the FETEN Award for its original proposal and environmental awareness, as well as the "R" rating as a recommended show by the National Theater Network. It also won the Audience Award for the best show at Titirimurcia and the best family show award at the Mostra de teatre d'Alcoi.

But the Ténéré tree was not always alone. Millions of years ago in that same spot, right where it stands now, there were other trees like it, and wild plants and animals, and water. Especially water. Our Ténéré tree loves to reminisce about that time, and it also enjoys dancing and swaying with the wind. It even receives visits from Tuareg caravans in the middle of the night, or from sun-dazed wanderers seeking some shade under its branches. The story of our Ténéré tree is a tale of roots, light, and shadows." } }

Nemo lives aboard the Nautilus, a secret submarine that travels the world's oceans, far from everyone and everything. But for some time now, the captain has noticed that coral reefs have turned into mountains of garbage, fish into plastic bags, and seagrass meadows into underwater dumpsites. Marine life is in danger, and Nemo is determined to prevent it, but he cannot do it alone. That's why he recruits Professor Aronax, whom he will take on a journey of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea to show him the secrets of this fascinating world threatened by human pollution. 'Nautilus' is a contemporary, committed, and ecological reading of the classic adventure novel '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea." } }
